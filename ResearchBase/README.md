# ResearchBase

This workspace houses your original-languages research corpus (texts, lexicons, grammars, commentaries, discourse/syntax, journals, notes, and datasets).

## Quick Start
1) Drop source texts in **00_texts** (e.g., SBLGNT, LXX, BHS/BHQ excerpts).
2) Add lexicon excerpts to **01_lexicons** (e.g., BDAG/HALOT entries you actively cite).
3) Keep grammars in **02_grammars** (Wallace, IBHS, etc.).
4) For a current project, select 1–2 technical + 1 pastoral commentary in **03_commentaries** (OT/NT).
5) Background dictionaries in **04_background_dictionaries** (AYBD, IVP), textual criticism in **05_textual_criticism**.
6) Discourse/syntax resources in **06_discourse_syntax**; journals in **07_journals**.
7) Export your Logos notes to **08_notes_highlights**.
8) Put CSV/JSON indices and RAG artifacts in **09_datasets_indices**.
